    <h1>Shardul Girase</h1>
    <h2>A student at Y.B. Patil Polytechnic with a deep passion for coding, web development, and app development. Ever since I started exploring the world of technology, I’ve been fascinated by how code can bring ideas to life. My ambition is to become a great coder who not only builds apps and websites, but also solves real-world technical problems with creative solutions.

        I was born on 14th December 2006, and along with tech, I have a strong love for cricket and a never-ending interest in learning. I currently have experience in HTML and CSS, which I use to build clean and responsive web pages. I’m constantly working to improve and learn more every day.
        
        What sets me apart is my competitiveness, communication skills, and the passion I bring into everything I do. I believe in growing step by step, and I’m excited to turn my skills into something impactful.
